"On Sunday night, Elon Musk announced on Twitter that the platform would lose its iconic name and bird logo in favors of a rather unembellished ‘X.’ Since then, the platform is losing traces of its Jack Dorsey-founded past, the mobile site has shed its feathers and has now done away with the bird logo completely. But while Elon Musk has kept the world guessing about why he ditched a name estimated to have billions of dollars worth of brand value, this isn’t the first time a major corporation has undergone a rebranding or a logo redesign. Here are some of the most notable examples of corporate identity transformations in the past decade. In 2015, Google ditched its rather curvy logo for a more simplified one. “Today we’re introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens,” noted the company in an announcement. The new logo, which features a sans-serif typeface and four primary colours, was designed to be simple, playful, and adaptable to different contexts and devices. The rebrand also introduced a new identity system, including a dynamic mic icon, a colourful dots animation, and a compact letter G. Instagram’s 2016 rebrand was a bold move that sparked mixed reactions from its users. The company purged its iconic retro camera logo for a minimalist gradient design that represented a simplified camera. The new logo was meant to reflect the vibrant and diverse stories that people share on the platform. Some praised the rebrand for being modern and sleek, while others criticized it for being generic and uninspired. The logo has lived into 2023 and continues to hold up well by today’s design standards. In late 2021, when Facebook was heavily focusing on the Metaverse, the social media company underwent a major rebrand to reflect its vision of building a metaverse – a virtual world where people can interact with each other and digital content. Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the metaverse will be “the next chapter for the internet” and “the future of social connection”. While that vision is yet to be realized, the company’s new name – Meta – is now widely recognized. The company also renamed its headset series from Oculus Quest to Meta Quest. In 2016, Uber replaced its black-and-white “U” logo with a circle and a square, which were meant to reflect the company’s vision of transportation as a basic human right. However, in 2018, Uber reverted to a wordmark logo with a custom font. In 2019, Google decided to give Android a fresh new look, with a more accessible and inclusive design. The new Android logo features a more vibrant green colour, mixed with blue and other shades to make it easier to see for colourblind people. The logo also has a curved shape that matches the wordmark and the robot. The new design reflects Android’s evolution and diversity, as well as its commitment to innovation and openness. Offices and gamers all seem to run to this Swiss computer parts manufacturer when it comes to reliable peripherals and software. In 2015, Logitech changed its name to Logi and introduced a new logo, colour palette, and product design. The new logo is a minimalist wordmark that drops the “tech” suffix and uses a geometric font. Slack’s 2019 rebrand was a major overhaul of its visual identity, aiming to create a more consistent and recognizable look across different platforms and applications. The rebrand was done by Slack’s in-house design and brand team, together with Pentagram, a renowned graphic design agency. The new logo is based on simple geometric shapes that form a pattern of speech bubbles and lozenges, representing the idea of collaboration and communication. It also reduced the number of colours from 11 to 4, making the logo more versatile and adaptable.","Elon Musk recently announced on Twitter that a well-known platform would undergo a rebranding, abandoning its iconic name and bird logo in favor of a simple 'X.' This move has sparked curiosity about the reasons behind the change, given the platform's significant brand value. However, this is not the first time a major corporation has undergone such a transformation. Several notable examples of corporate identity changes in the past decade include:

1. Google: In 2015, Google replaced its curvy logo with a more streamlined and adaptable design featuring a sans-serif typeface and four primary colors.

2. Instagram: In 2016, Instagram opted for a bold change by transitioning from its retro camera logo to a minimalist gradient design, reflecting the diverse stories shared on the platform.

3. Facebook (Meta): With a focus on the Metaverse, Facebook rebranded as Meta in late 2021 to align with its vision of creating a virtual world for social interaction.

4. Uber: In 2016, Uber changed its logo to represent transportation as a basic human right but later reverted to a wordmark logo in 2018.

5. Android: In 2019, Google revamped the Android logo with a more vibrant and inclusive design, catering to colorblind individuals.

6. Logitech: In 2015, Logitech became Logi and introduced a minimalist wordmark logo, dropping the ""tech"" suffix.

7. Slack: In 2019, Slack underwent a major rebrand to establish a consistent and recognizable visual identity, focusing on collaboration and communication.

These rebranding efforts aimed to convey the companies' evolving visions and values, enhance their visual appeal, and adapt to changing market demands. While some rebrands received mixed reactions, they have played a significant role in shaping these corporations' identities over the past decade."
"Ever since Elon Musk announced the new logo for Twitter speculations are rife about the reasons behind the Chief Twit’s actions. On Monday, Musk unveiled a new logo, X, for Twitter purging the iconic blue bird logo that has cast a lasting imprint on the collective psyche of billions of users. The new logo is a white X against the backdrop of pitch black and has already started to reflect on the web and mobile versions of the popular microblogging website. While Musk has kept the world guessing about the true meaning of the sudden overhaul, a new report seems to be hinting at his grander intentions. A report on CNBC now claims that the name X represents Musk’s ambitions to create an all-encompassing platform ‘everything app’. The 52-year-old technocrat said that the name Twitter made sense when it was just 140 characters going back and forth like birds tweeting. However, according to him now users can post ‘almost anything’.Musk’s comments come at a time when the move is being perceived as risky by analysts as it is reverting decades of branding that went into making the brand Twitter. Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 after a prolonged acquisition drama. Ever since the acquisition, the Tesla boss has made several sweeping changes such as staff reduction and introducing a subscription model where anyone could get the coveted verified badge. He had even momentarily changed the logo to that of a dog named Shiba Inu after taking over the platform. His most recent change was deploying former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino as CEO of Twitter. She took over the reigns as the new CEO on June 5, and the rebranding is the biggest development after her induction. On Monday, Yaccarino was among the executives who confirmed the rebranding. She took to her Twitter account to post “X is here! Let’s do this.” The CEO also posted a picture of the logo projected on the company’s offices in San Francisco. After her she was made the CEO, it was reported that Yaccarino was planning to bring about a slew of changes to Twitter to bring back advertisers who departed after Musk took over the platform. Her plans included introducing a video ads service, pursuing more celebrities and raising headcount.","Elon Musk's recent unveiling of Twitter's new logo, an X against a black background, has sparked speculation about his intentions behind the redesign. According to a CNBC report, the X represents Musk's vision of transforming Twitter into an all-encompassing platform or an 'everything app.' Musk believes that the name 'Twitter' made sense when it was limited to 140 characters like bird tweets, but now with expanded capabilities, users can post 'almost anything.' Since taking over Twitter in October 2022, Musk has made significant changes, including staff reductions, introducing a subscription model for verified badges, and even temporarily changing the logo to a Shiba Inu dog. Recently, he appointed Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal executive, as the new CEO of Twitter. Yaccarino confirmed the rebranding and is planning further changes, such as launching a video ads service, attracting more celebrities, and increasing the company's workforce. However, the move to rebrand Twitter after years of its established branding is seen as risky by some analysts."
"What looks like an unassuming celestial image released by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) could give clues about how planets as massive as Jupiter can form. Astronomers detected large dusty clumps close to a young star that could collapse to create giant planets. Researchers used ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to look at the material around the star V960 Mon, which is located over 5,000 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros. The star attracted astronomers’ attention when it increased its brightness more than twenty times in 2014. Observations of the star taken shortly after its “brightness outburst” showed that the material orbiting it was arranged together in a series of intricate spiral arms extending over distances that are bigger than our entire Solar System. This discovery encouraged astronomers to analyze archive observations of the same system made with ALMA. The VLT observations probed the surface of the dusty material around the star while ALMA was used to look deeper into its structure. There are two predominant theories that try to explain the formation of giant planets, according to ESO. One is that of “core accretion” where dust grains come together and coalesce. The other involves “gravitational instability,” where large clumps of material around a star contract and collapse. The first of these two scenarios has enough evidence to support it while evidence for the latter has been scant. But this new discovery about V960 Mons, which was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters brings forward more evidence that will allow astronomers to study how gravitational instability contributes to the formation of massive planets.","Astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's telescopes have found a significant celestial image that could provide insights into the formation of massive planets like Jupiter. They observed large dusty clumps near a young star, V960 Mon, located more than 5,000 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros. The star had a brightness outburst in 2014, drawing astronomers' attention. Subsequent observations revealed intricate spiral arms of material orbiting the star, extending beyond the size of our Solar System. These findings suggest that gravitational instability, the collapse of large clumps of material around a star, may play a crucial role in forming massive planets. This discovery adds to the evidence supporting this theory and allows astronomers to study the formation of massive planets in more detail. The study was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters."
"“The dual-screen tech has not expanded because it has not found a mass as far as the use case is concerned,” admits Dinesh Nair, Director – Consumer Business, Lenovo India. But Nair says Lenovo could succeed where other dual-screen devices have failed before, and the early reception seems promising.“ If you look at what’s happening today, especially post-pandemic, and the way consumers have evolved, and what people are using things for whether it’s their hybrid work, the need to connect, the need to create and the need to multitask, suddenly these devices are starting to seem very relevant,” Nair tells indianexpress.com in an interview on the sidelines of the launch of the dual-screen Yoga Book 9i. The Yoga Book 9i is a dual-screen touchscreen laptop with a second touchscreen on the bottom, replacing the keyboard and touchpad. It’s essentially two 13.3-inch, 16:10, 2.8K OLED screens stacked on top of each other with a hinge in the middle and a detachable keyboard, similar to the now-dead Microsoft Surface Neo. You can also fold this device at 90 degrees and use it like a regular 13-inch laptop. “You have to be able to build in the use case. Yes, there will be a bunch of consumers in the market, especially early adopters who love new tech but finally, something has to pick a mass… it has to have a solid use case and it has to then kind of fit into that sweet spot where consumers can actually afford the product,” he says. The PC giant Lenovo isn’t new to experimental laptop design, having launched notebooks with e-ink displays and foldable screens over the years. However, the Yoga Book 9i is the company’s best attempt at making dual-screen form factor work with the right blend of both software and hardware. “The concept behind the Yoga Book 9i actually started four years ago and was revisited in the past two years,” Gregory Beh, Category Manager Lenovo Asia Pacific, chimes in, adding that the company spent a lot of time studying the usage behavior of the targeted demography as well as got real-time feedback of existing products to create the Yoga Book 9i that meets the needs of the user. “The Yoga Book 9i is the end product of many years of research and development.” As Beh observed, there are consumers out there who would like to mimic a setup similar to a dual screen at home but in a compact device they can carry with them all the time. Think about designers, illustrators and coders who are the target consumers for a device like the Yoga Book 9i. “Productivity is not going to be deskbound whether you are at home or in the office…people will be working from every corner,” he says. Having two screens available both at the same time offers new types of use cases that traditional laptops can’t achieve with the current form and design. The hinge between the two screens still creates separation, but Lenovo’s clever software skills make this work. “If you look at the usage patterns for someone who is into coding or creating content, think about what they can do if it’s a seven or eight-inch screen, there’s only so much you can do. But with a dual-screen display laptop, which can work in different modes, it’s practically a lot easier for you to actually get your work done,” Nair explains the rationale behind going with two large 13.3-inch, OLED panels with 16:10 aspect ratios over smaller screens one would find on a tablet. The Yoga Book 9i doesn’t come cheap at Rs 2,24,990, but then Lenovo is targeting consumers who understand what they can do with a dual-screen laptop form factor. “It’s got the best of the hardware, the software, whether it’s the features inside it or the fact that practically it is something that has never been seen in the market before.” Getting the dual-screen form factor hasn’t been easy for Lenovo, and as a new product category, the company is committed to refining the design of the Yoga Book 9i going forward. “We are not looking at a one-time device. We are still improving on the software,” says Beh.” I think you will clearly see a lot more innovation and a lot many more improvements on these product lines in the next few months,” Nair reassures, underlining that the dual-screen form factor is here to stay.","Lenovo's Director of Consumer Business in India, Dinesh Nair, admits that dual-screen technology hasn't gained widespread adoption due to the lack of a compelling use case. However, he believes Lenovo's new dual-screen device, the Yoga Book 9i, could succeed where others have failed. Nair points out that post-pandemic, consumers' evolving needs for hybrid work, connectivity, creativity, and multitasking make such devices more relevant. The Yoga Book 9i is a dual-screen touchscreen laptop with two 13.3-inch, 16:10, 2.8K OLED screens stacked on top of each other and a detachable keyboard. Lenovo has spent years researching and developing the device, aiming to cater to designers, illustrators, and coders who seek a compact yet powerful setup that can be carried anywhere. The use of two large screens allows for unique use cases, particularly for coding and content creation, which are limited on smaller screens like tablets. While the Yoga Book 9i comes at a high price point, Lenovo is targeting consumers who understand and appreciate the benefits of the dual-screen laptop form factor. Despite the challenges in developing the dual-screen form factor, Lenovo remains committed to refining the design and improving the software for the Yoga Book 9i. They see it as a long-term product category with more innovation and improvements to come in the future. Nair assures that the dual-screen technology is here to stay."
"India is one of the fastest adopters of technology in the world. Affordable smartphones and data plans have helped millions of users get on board with digital services like UPI, WhatsApp, and more. Unfortunately, hackers also see this as an opportunity resulting in a surge in cybercrimes over the last few years. Miscreants have been using platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp to steal identities and then use the same to extort money from the victim and their friends and family. Kolkata Police cyber cell has begun an awareness program on social media platforms to educate and protect citizens against possible online scams. According to the police, scammers made use of World Yoga Day 2023 momentum and targeted individuals claiming to offer a free link to join an online yoga session. When an unaware user clicks on the link, they will be asked to share a six-digit OTP. Once shared the scammers get remote access to the user’s WhatsApp account, where the same will be used to impersonate and extract money from friends and family, pretending to be in an emergency. Some criminals take this a step further and force victims to invest in a bonus cryptocurrency, which will then be withdrawn, eliminating the digital trace of the scam. After several of these cases surfaced, Kolkata Cyber police are now warning users to be vigilant, especially while receiving a message with a link and also suggest users not forward these messages to anyone and report it to WhatsApp. Always be vigilant, and never click on an external link received on WhatsApp or as an SMS, unless you are sure. If someone from your contact requests for money, make sure that it’s indeed your friend or family member before transferring. The best way to do this is by video or voice calling them. Never share sensitive information like OTP with someone over a message. Make sure that two-factor authentication is enabled on all social media platforms. Lastly, if you find a message suspicious, report it to WhatsApp or the respective platform moderators.","The rapid adoption of technology in India has led to an increase in cybercrimes.

"Just days after celebrating its first anniversary, NASA has shared another James Webb Space Telescope photo. This high-resolution near-infrared image captures two stars that are actively forming. To find them in the image, follow the bright pink and red diffraction spikes until you hit the centre The stars, known as Herbig-Haro 46/47, are within the orange-white blob in the image. There, they are buried deep inside a disc of gas and dust that is feeding their growth as they get bigger. Interestingly, the stars are only a few thousand years old, which means that they are quite young in cosmic terms. Typically, star systems take millions of years to fully form. Looking at systems like Herbig-Haro 46/47 can give scientists insights into how much mass stars gather over time, potentially allowing them to model how our own Sun formed along with the solar system. The two-sided lobes moving out from the forming central stars can be seen in a burning orange colour. A lot of this material was shot out from those stars as they repeatedly consumed and ejected the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them over thousands of years. When the material ejected recently crashes into older material, it changes the shape of these lobes.NASA likens this to a large fountain being turned on and off rapidly and randomly. Some jets in the image send out more material than others at faster speeds. This is related to how much material fell onto the stars at a particular point in time. The thread-like blue in the image is the more recently-ejected materials. They make clearer wavy patterns along the right side. They are disconnected at points and end in an uneven light purple circle in the orange area.","NASA has released a new image from the James Webb Space Telescope, capturing two actively forming stars known as Herbig-Haro 46/47.

"Is AI capable of possessing emotional intelligence? The answer is a complex one. However, Geoffrey Hinton, also known as father of AI who recently left Google thinks that AI has or will soon have emotions. The 75-year-old cognitive psychologist and computer scientist shared his thoughts while delivering a talk at King’s College in London recently. When asked if AI systems can one day possess emotional intelligence, Hinton said, “I think they could well have feelings. They won’t have pain the way you do unless we wanted, but things like frustration and anger, I don’t see why they shouldn’t have those.” According to Hinton, deep learning can achieve and even overtake human-like intelligence. He suggested that AI systems could have feelings like anger and frustration. Hinton’s views are based on the definition of feelings which relates to hypothetical actions (I feel like punching someone’s nose) to communicate about emotional state. This is something AI systems can already do. The former Google executive also added that he refrained from publicly stating this notion earlier owing to the resistance to his first thesis about superior AI threatening humanity. However, in practical terms, Hinton’s thesis is difficult to verify, as presently LLMs can only project statistically probable emotions which they attained through training. Whether they actually have feelings as an entity can only be proved by clarifying consciousness. And there is no scientific tool to gauge consciousness. In May this year, Hinton made headlines following his departure from Google after his decade-long association with the search giant. Hinton went on to warn about the dangers of rapidly developing AI without analyzing its impact. “I left [Google] so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,” he was quoted as saying after his exit. Hinton’s impact on the advancement of AI systems has been profound. Back in 1986, he played a pivotal role in co-authoring the paper ‘Learning representations by back-propagating errors,’ which served as a groundbreaking step in the evolution of neural networks, the foundation of AI technology. For his exceptional research breakthroughs, Hinton’s contributions were recognized in 2018 with the prestigious Turing Award.","Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the father of AI, believes that AI has the potential to possess emotions.

"nCORE Games, the studio that brought us FAU-G, is back with what looks like a sequel (or a reboot?) to the ill-fated original. The new game, called FAU-G Domination, promises to introduce us to “never seen before” characters, guns, and game modes/tournaments. In a tweet that oozes with patriotism, nCORE Games says that the game is a tribute “to our bravehearts of India” on the occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas. However, they have not revealed any other details about the game, such as its release date and gameplay features. The tweet also suggests that nCORE Games is targeting the esports market in India with FAU-G Domination, which could mean that the game will have competitive modes and events. However, given the track record of nCORE Games, this might be too optimistic to expect. nCORE is the same studio that launched FAU-G on 26 January 2021 with much fanfare and hype, only to disappoint millions of players with its rather short campaign, clunky controls, and poor optimization. The game also promised to add multiplayer modes like Team Death match and Free for All, but they never materialized. The game’s last update was on 5 March 2021 and since then it has been collecting dust on the Play Store and App Store. nCORE Games then tried to salvage the situation by releasing FAU-G Multiplayer, a separate title that was supposed to deliver the multiplayer experience that FAU-G failed to provide. However, this game also bombed, as it never came out of early access and stopped receiving updates. Now with FAU-G Domination, nCORE Games seems to be recycling the same old formula of using patriotism as a selling point, but how well that works depends entirely on the game.","nCORE Games, the studio behind FAU-G, is launching a new game called FAU-G Domination.

"Former United States Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch had earlier made claims that the country is in possession of alien aircraft. Grusch on Wednesday made the same claims while testifying to the US Congress under oath, also hinting that the country may be in possession of alien bodies. Grusch claims that the country’s government conducted a “multi-decade” program where it collected and attempted to reverse-engineer crashed unidentified flying objects (UFOs), according to The Guardian. He led the analysis of unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP, an official US government term for UFOs) within the Department of Defense until recently. He also goes on to claim that he has been denied access to secret government UFO programs and that he knows of “people who have been harmed or injured” during the government’s efforts to conceal UFO information. The Pentagon (Department of Defense) has denied Grusch’s claims in a statement. Spokesperson Sue Gough said that investigators have not discovered “any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently,” according to AP. When US congresswoman Nancy Mace asked Grusch whether any of the alien crafts’ pilots’ bodies were recovered, Grusch said, “As I have stated publicly already, biologics came with some of these recoveries. Mace probed further, asking whether the biologics were human or non-human. “Non-human, and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge of the program that I talked to,” answered Grusch. Grush told The Debrief last month that the US government, its allies and defense contracts have been making recoveries of partial and fully intact vehicles for many decades. According to him, analysis has determined that those objects are “of exotic origin,” which means that they are either extraterrestrial or of unknown origin.","Former US Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch testified under oath to the US Congress, reiterating his claims that the country possesses alien aircraft and may also have alien bodies.

"Elon Musk has yet again dominated the news feeds. This time for rebranding Twitter with a new logo – X. Even as the tech world is coming to terms with the undoing of the brand name of the world’s most popular microblogging site, Musk has asserted the method behind his swift change. All of this aligns with his plans to build the all-encompassing ‘everything app’ in the future. However, there seems to be a dark side to the rebranding. Musk’s X app has switched from @Twitter to @X and reportedly the billionaire technocrat has not paid the previous owner of the handle to acquire the one-letter handle. According to reports, the single-letter handle was previously registered to an individual identified as Gene X Hwang who is the co-founder of a company known as Orange Photography. Hwang had registered the handle some 16 years ago, however, now the handle no longer belongs to him. A report in the Independent stated that Hwang on Tuesday said that he was not approached by Musk nor X before the handle was taken over. And on Wednesday the account was taken by the rebranded Twitter. On Wednesday, Hwang took to his new handle @x12345678998765 and tweeted “All’s well that ends well”. His tweet attracted over 113K likes and 14.5K retweets. Meanwhile, another report in The Telegraph said that neither Musk nor his company paid any money to Hwang before taking over his handle. Incidentally, this is not the first time that Musk took over other Twitter accounts after he acquired the platform. The rebranding was announced on Sunday night, and on Monday, the headquarters of Twitter saw the removal of the old signage and installation of the X logo.","Elon Musk, known for his dominating presence in the news, recently rebranded Twitter with a new logo - X, in line with his plans to create an all-encompassing 'everything app' in the future.

"At Google I/O 2022, the tech giant announced a plethora of changes to how the Play Store will look on large-screen devices like tablets, foldable phones and Chromebooks Now, the tech giant has rolled out a revamped version of the app with four major changes that will enhance user experience and help them find high-quality apps. Google has reorganized the apps and games details page, with large screens now supporting a multi-column layout. As for games, titles with high-quality videos will now show a video banner at the top of the app listing page, making it easy for users to check what the gameplay looks like. Apps and games that meet Google’s standard for large-screen devices will be ranked higher in the store. The change will also affect Editor’s Choice and other curated collections and articles and help users find apps that resize well and are not letterboxed. The tech giant is also working on a new feature that will offer a preview of how the app will look on your device and help them decide if they want to install it. Google says the feature will start rolling out in late August and show a warning on the top of the app details page. Apps optimized for large-screen devices will now take a preference over apps that do not scale or look well. As part of the UI overhaul, the bottom tab now appears on the left of the device when held in landscape mode. The Top Charts and Categories section is now available in Apps and Games home, whereas Kids is now a primary tab on large-screen devices. Another major change is that searching an app on the Play Store will now offer a split-screen experience, with one half showing search results and the other half providing app details. All the aforementioned changes will be rolling out to large-screen devices like foldables, tablets and Chromebooks in the coming weeks, so you might have to wait a while before the new interface is available on your device.","Google I/O 2022 brought significant updates for the Play Store on large-screen devices like tablets, foldable phones, and Chromebooks.

"Soon after Samsung announced the Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5 and a bunch of other products at its Galaxy Unpacked event, a company exec hinted in an interview with Android Authority about an upcoming Galaxy FE device. When the publication asked Justin Hume, the vice president of Samsung’s mobile division in South Africa if there was a “FE-sized gap between the Galaxy A54 5G and Galaxy S23”, the company executive said, “There is going to be an announcement made. Imminently.” While Hume did not specifically suggest the name ‘Galaxy S23 FE’, several leaks and rumors hint that Samsung is working on a new Galaxy FE phone. Last month, renders of the Galaxy S23 FE surfaced on the internet suggesting the new phone will have a design language similar to Samsung’s S23 series. Rumors has it that the phone will sport a 6.4-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen and pack a triple camera setup with the primary camera featuring a 50MP sensor. The Galaxy S23 FE might feature the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset or Exynos 2200 chipset and come with 8GB RAM and up to 256GB storage. Recently, the device was also spotted on China’s 3C listing with model number SM-S7110, with the certificate hinting that Samsung might limit the charging speed to 25W and pack a 4,500mAh battery, which is the same as the Galaxy S21 FE.","Samsung hinted at an upcoming Galaxy FE device during its Galaxy Unpacked event, as confirmed by Justin Hume, the vice president of Samsung's mobile division in South Africa.

"X, previously known as Twitter, now has a new official handle — X. As a part of the ongoing branding transition, the microblogging platform has abandoned the older @twitter handle and has replaced it with the new @x. The beta version of the Android app for the platform has also begun reflecting these changes with a new icon and replacing the bird with an ‘X’ inside. At first, the @twitter handle was renamed to X, and now, the company has made the @twitter handle private and has transitioned into @x. Twitter’s earlier official handle (@twitter) is no longer active and suggests users follow the new handle (@x), which currently has more than 66 million followers. Elon Musk recently hinted that Twitter will undergo a major branding makeover via a cryptic tweet. Since then, the microblogging platform is undergoing a rapid transition. According to Linda Yaccarino, the new CEO of X, “Powered by AI” and “X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.” She also stated that “We’ve already started to see X take shape over the past 8 months through our rapid feature launches, but we’re just getting started.” Twitter has been undergoing rapid changes since Elon Musk bought the platform back in October 2022. This includes locking various features behind the paywall, removal of blue tick from verified prominent handles, and now the major rebranding that the platform is currently undergoing.","Twitter, now known as X, has made significant changes to its branding.

"Amazon.com’s cloud division has drawn thousands of customers to try out its service vying with Microsoft and Google in a key area of artificial intelligence, an executive told Reuters. The company also announced new AI tools on Wednesday, including a program for building more conversational customer-service agents, technology access from the startup Cohere and a healthcare system for generating clinical notes after a patient visit. Organizations including Sony, Ryanair and Sun Life have tried out Amazon Bedrock, a service the company announced in April that lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, Vice President Swami Sivasubramanian said. Such generative technology can produce new text, images and other content on command. “Our mission is to make every company an AI company,” said Sivasubramanian, in an interview pegged to a summit the cloud provider hosted in New York. Amazon Bedrock is the company’s answer to services announced by Google and Microsoft, cloud rivals that have developed or marketed AI garnering significant public attention. Microsoft has invested in OpenAI, the startup that created ChatGPT and the AI model known as GPT-4. Amazon’s disclosure of thousands of Bedrock users, previously unreported, shows its efforts are attracting interest as well. The company wants to offer a broader range of AI models than peers to win business, including access to updated technology from startups Anthropic and Stability AI, announced Wednesday. Amazon’s role as the largest cloud provider by revenue – already hosting myriad customers’ data – distinguishes it, too, the company has said. Amazon Bedrock will become available generally to any customer very “soon,” Sivasubramanian said. He declined to state when, adding the company aims to address issues around cost allocation and enterprise controls first. Industry has continued to grapple with the costs of AI more generally. Microsoft on Tuesday reported its highest quarterly capital expenditures since at least its fiscal 2016 as it builds data centers to support AI and battles other cloud companies for key chips from Nvidia. Asked whether Amazon has given businesses with big AI ambitions a deadline to secure chip access, Sivasubramanian said, “We are working with them to ensure we understand their ramp-up schedule.” The company meanwhile widened access to technology it billed as more efficient for training AI, based on Nvidia chips. The cloud provider also previewed Agents for Amazon Bedrock, which lets businesses create chatbots that execute tasks and give more personalized answers drawing from their proprietary data. An airline could build a virtual agent that books a flight for a traveler, for instance, based on a customer’s price, destination and seating requests. The business potential for such agents have recently gripped Silicon Valley. And as part of its AI push, the company made an appeal to the healthcare industry specifically. It announced a service called AWS HealthScribe to let software vendors build apps to transcribe and analyze conversations between a doctor and patient.","Amazon.com's cloud division is attracting thousands of customers, competing with Microsoft and Google in the AI sector.

"Samsung Electronics flagged on Thursday a gradual global chip demand recovery after an ongoing glut led to continued losses in the technology giant’s key business in the June quarter, despite a production cut. “Looking to the second half of the year, the (memory chip) market is expected to gradually move toward stability considering increasing production cuts in the industry,” the world’s biggest memory chip and smartphone maker said in a statement. Chip clients are expected to move from using up inventory to buying semiconductors again, the South Korean company added, a day after rival SK Hynix also pointed to a nascent market recovery amid robust artificial intelligence demand. Samsung reported a 95% plunge in June quarter profit, as the chip industry’s downturn persisted despite output cuts because of weaker demand for products reliant on semiconductors from consumer gadgets to servers. Operating profit fell to 669 billion won ($527 million) in April-June, from 14.1 trillion won a year earlier. That was broadly in line with the company’s estimate of 600 billion won this month, and was the second-lowest quarterly profit in 14 years. Revenue fell 22% to 60 trillion won. Its chip division reported a 4.36 trillion won loss during the quarter, a continued divergence for what is normally Samsung’s most important cash cow. It had reported a 9.98 trillion won profit a year earlier. Chip losses shrank slightly from the first quarter’s 4.58 trillion won due to strong memory chip demand from AI, which led to higher-than-expected shipments of DRAM chips that hold information from applications while the system is in use. Samsung’s chip contract manufacturing business fared worse, experiencing a “significant” profit decline in the June quarter due to uncertainties in short-term demand, it said. Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, lowered its annual sales guidance this month and warned of cost challenges as it battles weak global demand. Samsung shares were down 0.7% in early trade, versus a 0.6% rise in the wider market after the chip division losses exceeded market estimates. The company said it spent 14.5 trillion won in capital expenditures during the second quarter, of which 13.5 trillion won was spent on chips. It is expected to begin shipping advanced 4-nanometre chips from its Taylor, Texas factory in late 2024, according to CEO Kyung Kye-hyun, while it is also setting up more production in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. Samsung’s mobile business reported a 3.04 trillion won profit in the June quarter, up from 2.62 trillion won a year earlier. It forecast the overall smartphone market would return to year-on-year growth in the second half, especially at the premium end.","Samsung Electronics reported a sharp decline in its June quarter profit, largely attributed to the ongoing glut in the chip industry. Despite production cuts, weaker demand for products reliant on semiconductors continued to impact the company's earnings. However, Samsung remains optimistic about the future, expecting a gradual recovery in the memory chip market during the second half of the year. The company believes that chip clients will resume buying semiconductors as they exhaust their inventory. The losses in the chip division were partially offset by strong memory chip demand from AI applications. Additionally, Samsung's mobile business showed improvement, with a profit of 3.04 trillion won in the June quarter. The company predicts a return to year-on-year growth in the smartphone market, particularly in the premium segment. Samsung plans to invest in chip production and aims to ship advanced 4-nanometre chips from its Texas factory by late 2024."
"Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 Pro series could see price increases compared to the current models, according to fresh claims made by Analyst Tim Long from Barclays. This is something that several analysts and tipsters have also suggested in the past few months. Based on conversations with supply chain companies in Asia, he predicts the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max could be way more expensive than last year's Pro models. However, pricing for the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models could remain the same. Here is all we know so far. The cited source claims that the price of the iPhone 15 and its Plus model will not change. This basically means that the standard model could cost $799 in the US and Rs 79,900 in India when it launches in the coming months. If this happens, then this would be the second time that Apple will be selling the regular model at the price of the iPhone 13. The iPhone 15 Plus is said to be priced at $899 or Rs 89,900. Coming to the more expensive models, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models are tipped to get a massive price hike. The iPhone 15 Pro could be priced at $1,099, which is up from last year's model price of $999. In India, Apple introduced the iPhone 14 Pro with an increase of $300 compared to the US market. Hence, the price of last year's model is Rs 1,29,900, instead of Rs 99,900. It is important to note that Apple pegs each dollar at Rs 100. So, the above calculation is based on this figure. Now, the analyst says that the iPhone 15 Pro will get a $99 price hike, meaning India's price could be increased by Rs 10,000. So, Apple may decide to launch the Pro model at Rs 1,39,900. Similarly, the iPhone 15 Pro Max could be unveiled at $1,299, up from last year's model price of $1,099. But, with an increase of $300, Apple launched the iPhone 14 Pro Max in India at Rs 1,39,900. Now, if we go by what the analyst says, the iPhone 15 Pro Max will get a $200 price hike, meaning India's price could be increased by Rs 20,000. So, Apple could announce the new Pro Max model at Rs 1,59,900. But, users are advised to take the details with a pinch of salt, considering these are not the official prices from Apple. The iPhone 15 event will likely take place in September this year, similar to previous launches. The company is soon expected to reveal the exact date for the upcoming Apple event.","According to analyst Tim Long from Barclays, Apple's forthcoming iPhone 15 Pro series is likely to be more expensive than the current models.

On the other hand, the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models are expected to maintain the same pricing. Based on information from supply chain companies in Asia, the iPhone 15 and its Plus variant are anticipated to retain their current prices, with the standard model priced at $799 in the US and Rs 79,900 in India. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 Plus might be priced at $899 or Rs 89,900 in India. The higher-end models, iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, are likely to get substantial price hikes. The iPhone 15 Pro could be priced at $1,099, up from last year's $999. In India, last year's Pro model was launched at Rs 1,29,900, but with the predicted $99 increase, the new Pro model may cost Rs 1,39,900. Similarly, the iPhone 15 Pro Max might be unveiled at $1,299, up from last year's $1,099. The speculated $200 increase would bring the Pro Max model's price in India to Rs 1,59,900. It is important to note that these are not official prices from Apple, and the actual prices may differ. The iPhone 15 event is expected to take place in September, similar to previous launches, and Apple is likely to announce the exact date for the event soon."
"Reddit, currently riding on the success of its previously released NFTs, has made another splash in the digital collectibles market. The social networking platform has launched the fourth generation of its digital avatars created on the eco-friendly Polygon blockchain. The NFT collection has been named as ‘Retro Reimagined'. The avatars from this collection will feature Reddit's official ‘Snoo' alien mascot, reimagined by artists and creators in different kinds of apparels and moods. “These avatars are limited edition, meaning a set number of each artist's Collectible Avatars are available for purchase. This allows artists to be paid for every Avatar sold,” Reddit wrote in an official blog post, commenting on the development. While Reddit has not disclosed how many NFTs will be part of this collection, it revealed the price points that are decided for the NFTs of the Retro Reimagined series. Each tokenised avatar from this collection will cost between $2.49 (roughly Rs. 205) and $199.99 (roughly Rs. 16 lakh). In addition, the platform said that the collection showcases NFT designs from 100 independent artists. Some avatars are also inspired by popular NFT collections like Cool Cats. Reddit community members have already begun showing their new avatars from the Retro Reimagined collection on Twitter. Reddit was launched in June, 2005 in the US. At present, the platform is estimated to have 55.79 million daily active users and 1.660 billion monthly active users as of July 2023. Its pivot towards Web3 happened when it introduced NFTs as “Collectible Avatars” on Polygon in July 2022 via free airdrops and early sales — getting people to engage with the collectibles. Later in 2022, Reddit launched its own NFT marketplace. To shop from this online marketplace, people are required to set up a Reddit Vault Wallet to purchase and store NFTs. By December last year, Reddit had reportedly garnered over 4.25 million total unique wallets and 3.9 million out of these wallets possessed at least a single Reddit NFT. Since Reddit avatars are limited edition, they have been known to fetch substantial funds in resales for artists as well as holders. As per a Decrypt report, around $33.6 million (roughly Rs. 275 crore) worth of the Reddit avatars have already been traded on secondary markets. The platform, however, has announced come tweaks in the process via which people can purchase its NFTs. “We learned a few things from the last drop, so we are launching GEN 4 with a few things that will impact your Shop experience. Captcha is now enabled for all Shop purchases, so please don't forget to confirm that you are indeed not a (ro)bot. In order to promote a more equitable purchase experience, we are launching this drop with initial access. It means that for the first day of launch, your account age and other metrics will be taken into consideration and there will also be restrictions on how many Collectibles you can purchase at a time,” its blog noted.","Reddit has unveiled its fourth-generation NFT collection called ""Retro Reimagined"" on the eco-friendly Polygon blockchain.

"PlayStation Plus' monthly free games for August 2023 have been announced. The three titles will be available to members of PS Plus Essential, Extra, and Deluxe/ Premium plans, starting August 1. Members can compete to become the next FedExCup Champion in PGA Tour 2K23, slay armies of fantastical beasts and demigods in Death's Door, and dive into the ever-changing universe of Dreams, which is laden with community-created games and tools to unleash your creativity. These games can be added to your PS4 and PS5 games library until September 4, after which you'll need to hold on to your PS Plus subscription for continued access. Much later, on August 29, Sea of Stars, the retro-styled turn-based RPG from Sabotage Studio, will become the first title to drop on the PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass services simultaneously. The eye-catching indie game is presented in the style of acclaimed titles like Chrono Trigger and follows two children who'd combine the powers of the sun and moon to perform an ‘Eclipse Magic,' which is capable of defending the lands against the monstrous creations of an evil alchemist. In addition to ditching the genre's tile-based movement formula, it reinvents the combat — timing the action button in sync with the animation exerts more damage. A free demo for Sea of Stars is out now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Circling back to next month's PS Plus additions, Sony confirmed the entries on its PlayStation Blog late on Wednesday, adding that members have until July 31 to add July's free games to their library. The lineup includes Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, the episodic horror game Alan Wake Remastered, and Endling – Extinction is Forever, where you explore a ravaged world through the eyes of the last fox on the planet. Drive, putt, and chip your way through in the FedExCup to become the next champion against Tour professionals, as you build new rivalries. The officially licensed golf sim from 2K streamlines controls by adding a 3-Click swing system that has you time buttons to determine the swing accuracy, in addition to keeping the traditional analog stick for the old-timers. PGA Tour 2K23 also marks the first entry to include both male and female pro golfers — including Tiger Woods, who's a key part of the marketing — across both online and local sessions. Build your own dream courses, level up your skills and archetypes in MyPlayer, or put on licensed apparel to represent yourself on the pitch. PGA Tour 2K23 will be available to play on both PS4 and PS5. Collecting lost souls can be a pretty monotonous job for the Reaper Crow, that is until your assigned soul gets stolen, sending you on a fetch quest out in the world of the living where monstrous creatures thrive, consumed with greed and power. Death's Door's 3D isometric world and design mimic Dark Souls and Zelda games, where progression relies on character customisation, as you master its tricky combat — melee, magic, and long-range, clear environmental puzzles, and defeat colossal bosses who have backstories of their own. Venture past the doors to uncover the truths behind the lost souls, a crow's role in all of this, and bring hope to the tarnished realm. Death's Door will be available to play on both PS4 and PS5. A month before developer Media Molecule ends live support for Dreams, its ever-expanding digital playground heads to PS Plus. That said, players should still be able to create their own pieces of art renders, music, or games and share them with the larger online community. However, it won't be receiving any further game updates, nor will the developer host community-driven events like the Impy Awards and DreamsCom.

The first hot test was conducted on July 19, 2023,"" the Bengaluru-headquartered national space agency said in a statement. ISRO said three more hot tests are scheduled, to demonstrate de-boosting requirements and off-nominal mission scenarios. The SMPS is designed and developed by the Liquid Propulsion System Centre located at Bengaluru and Valiamala, Thiruvananthapuram. During the tests on Wednesday, the thrusters were operated in both continuous and pulse mode, in sync with the mission profile. The initial hot test which lasted for 723.6 seconds focused on demonstrating Orbital Module injection and the calibration burn of 100 Newton thrusters and Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) engines. ""The calibration burn was essential to identify and isolate any non-operational engines. The LAM engines and reaction control system (RCS) Thrusters performed as expected,"" the statement said. ""The latter hot test, with a duration of 350 seconds, aimed to demonstrate the circularisation of the Orbital Module to achieve the final orbit. During this test, the LAM engines operated in continuous mode, while the RCS Thrusters fired in pulse mode,"" it added.","ISRO has successfully conducted two more ""hot tests"" on the Gaganyaan Service Module Propulsion System (SMPS) as part of preparations for India's first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan. The tests were carried out at the ISRO Propulsion Complex in Tamil Nadu. The Gaganyaan mission aims to demonstrate human spaceflight capabilities by sending a crew of three members to a 400km orbit for a three-day mission and safely bringing them back to Earth, landing in Indian sea waters. These tests are meant to validate and refine the propulsion system's performance for the upcoming mission. The SMPS, designed and developed by the Liquid Propulsion System Centre, Bengaluru, and Thiruvananthapuram, was tested in both continuous and pulse modes to match the mission profile. The tests demonstrated the successful operation of thrusters, engines, and the reaction control system. Three more hot tests are scheduled to demonstrate de-boosting requirements and off-nominal mission scenarios."

"Meta has recorded an eleven percent year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth for the second quarter of 2023, between the months of April and June. Despite Meta having recorded one of its best quarters since its rebranding from Facebook in 2021, the company's metaverse sector remains lacklustre. Meta's revenue climbed to $32 billion (roughly Rs. 2,62,377 crore) in the second quarter of 2023. Its fiscal second-quarter net income in 2023 was $7.79 billion (roughly Rs. 63,870 crore), up from $6.7 billion (roughly Rs. 54,928 crore) from the last year's second quarter. Meta, in its latest earnings call, did not disclose exactly how much its metaverse-related unit Reality Labs lost this quarter. The company did however say that it's metaverse unit is expecting to see more losses in the coming times. “While we are not providing a quantitative outlook beyond 2023 at this point, we expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024 as we continue to invest in our most compelling opportunities, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the metaverse. For Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR) and investments to further scale our ecosystem,” Meta's report said. Reality Labs, the metaverse-focussed division of Meta, lost a whopping $13.7 billion (roughly Rs. 1,12,200 crore) last year. The company's optimistic approach towards the metaverse, however, does not come as quite a surprise after all, its rebranding revolves largely around this up-and-coming technology. In May 2023, Meta also commissioned a study that claimed that the metaverse could contribute as much as $760 billion (roughly Rs. 62,36,088 crore) or about 2.4 percent to the US annual gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035. The company suffered a rough 2022 amid a souring economic climate. This forced advertisers to cut back on marketing, and Apple's data privacy changes, which reportedly have reduced leeway for ad personalisation. After incurring back-to-back quarterly losses last year and industrial roadblocks, Meta had no option but to take tough, cost-effective decisions. Earlier this year, Meta became the first Big Tech company to layoff over 11,000 employees. Later in April, another batch of 4,000 Meta employees were left jobless. Meta's profit for 2023 Q2 could be attributed to its internal restructuring.","Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has experienced an 11% year-on-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2023, reaching $32 billion in revenue and $7.79 billion in net income. Despite this positive performance, Meta's metaverse sector, called Reality Labs, has been struggling and incurred significant losses. The company expects more losses in the future due to investments in Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR) and ecosystem expansion. Last year, Reality Labs recorded a massive loss of $13.7 billion. Nevertheless, Meta remains optimistic about the metaverse's potential, as its rebranding has been focused on this emerging technology. They commissioned a study suggesting the metaverse could contribute around $760 billion to the US GDP by 2035. The company faced challenges in 2022 due to economic conditions and data privacy changes, leading to job layoffs and cost-cutting measures. Despite these hurdles, Meta's recent profit in Q2 2023 can be attributed to internal restructuring efforts."
